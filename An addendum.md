I made this new public repo for the lab notebook submission. 
I don't currently want to have my code in a public repo until it is in a more cleaner/polished state. 
But, I do like version control and think GitHub has many great uses, so I think it's good there was a mini-unit on it in class. 
So, cheers to that. :+1:
